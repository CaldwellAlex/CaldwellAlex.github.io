## The Diversity of Firing
The Izhikevich model is a powerful "phenomenological" model. It doesn't aim to simulate every ion channel; instead, it uses a simplified system of two differential equations to replicate the *behavior* of almost any known cortical neuron.

### The Dynamics
The model is defined by:
$$v' = 0.04v^2 + 5v + 140 - u + I$$
$$u' = a(bv - u)$$

Where $v$ represents the membrane potential and $u$ is a recovery variable providing negative feedback.



### Implementation Highlights
* **Parameter Mapping:** I implemented a library of 20 distinct neuron types (Regular Spiking, Fast Spiking, Chattering, etc.) based on the original 2003/2004 papers.
* **Phase Plane Analysis:** My simulation includes a visualization of the $v-u$ phase plane, allowing users to see how nullclines and fixed points shift to create different spiking regimes.
* **Interactive Selector:** Using Pluto.jl, visitors can toggle between neuron types to instantly see changes in the spike train.

## Why it Matters
This model bridges the gap between the biorealistic (Hodgkin-Huxley) and the abstract (LIF). It is the gold standard for large-scale simulations where biological variety is required without the immense computational cost of conductance-based models.
