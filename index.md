# Hello, I'm Alex

I'm an undergraduate Neuroscientist at Cardiff University, interested in computational and theoretical neuroscience, as well as interdisciplinary approaches to understanding the brain.

### 🧠 Research Interests
* **Computational Neuroscience** - How sensory information is processed and represented in the brain, how it influences decision making and behaviour, and how this can be modelled computationally.
* **Theoretical Neuroscience** - The theoretical underpinnings of neural computation, and how this can be used to understand brain function.
* **Interdisciplinary Approaches** - How neuroscience can be combined with other fields, such as computer science, physics, and mathematics, to understand the brain.
